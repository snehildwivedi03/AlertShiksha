        Why Disaster Preparedness?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and fires often strike
        without warning. Schools and colleges are especially vulnerable due to
        lack of structured safety education.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Preparedness reduces panic, saves lives, and ensures communities recover
        faster. By equipping young people with knowledge, we create a culture of
        resilience.
